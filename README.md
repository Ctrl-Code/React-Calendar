A calendar made using react library to compensate for the input field in the html which uses type="calendar" and KABOOM is not browser compatible. lol.

### TO GET UP RUNNING WITH THE BETA BRANCH
```
git checkout beta
```
NOTE: Not Important: beta is hindi means 'son'.
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
Automatically the default browser should open up with the link [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you can view the 'beta' work.
